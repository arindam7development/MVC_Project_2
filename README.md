MVC_Project_2
=============
FRS on struts. It is a Flight Reservation System based on MVC architecture. It is a complete flight management solution . It is built on struts framework. Here I have separated the presentation layer and the logical layer.It is purely based on MVC architecture.
Here I used Oracle database at backend , but FRS is completely independent of the choice of our database. I have separated the code in different layer (Three Tier Architecture).When you will go through the code , you will find a DBUtil package .All the code for making the connection to the database is present in DBUtil package only
